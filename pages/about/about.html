    My name is Peter Chkwuemeka and I believe that a person with good character includes traits like loyalty, honesty, courage, integrity, fortitude, and other  important virtues that promote good behavior. A person with good character chooses do the right thing because he or she believes it is the morally right to do so. The key to successful personal development is adopting a mindful attitude. The ability to step back to  and take a “good hard look” at yourself and your life is crucial when it comes to developing a strong character. However, this often easier said than done, as we so often get caught up in the moment. In general, showing integrity, respecting others and yourself, not discriminating, including others in decision-making, demonstrating empathy and compassion, being accountable are some of the behaviors that define a good character. That is why showing a good character not only at work, but everywhere is very important
